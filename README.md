Zoom to cursor mod for Cities: Skylines without any dependencies

# How to install the mod localy

Once you have created and compiled the mod, Visual Studio generates a .dll file. This file contains the code of the mod and needs to be placed in the correct folder so that Cities: Skylines can load it.

The path to the mods folder in Cities: Skylines depends on your operating system. On Windows, you can typically find it here:

C:\Users\[Your Username]\AppData\Local\Colossal Order\Cities_Skylines\Addons\Mods\[Name of the Mod]\

Replace [Your Username] with your actual username and [Name of the Mod] with the name of your mod. This folder should contain the .dll file of the mod.

For example, if your username is user and you have named the mod ZoomToCursorMod, the path should look like this:

C:\Users\user\AppData\Local\Colossal Order\Cities_Skylines\Addons\Mods\ZoomToCursorMod\

Copy the .dll file into this folder. The next time you start Cities: Skylines, you should see the mod in the game's mod menu. Remember to activate it for the changes to take effect.

Note: The AppData folder is typically hidden, so you may need to show hidden folders to access it. You can also type %LocalAppData% into the address bar of the File Explorer to directly go to the AppData\Local folder.
